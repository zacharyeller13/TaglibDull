# TaglibDull

A basic ID3v2 tag reader and writer.  

[TaglibSharp](https://github.com/mono/taglib-sharp) is of probably the gold standard for reading tag information from media files in the .NET world. I've been dreaming up another music-related personal project and could use TaglibSharp but want to use this as a learning opportunity and instead just implement my own, much more limited tag reader. 

This library is not and never will come close in API breadth, depth, or quality.
